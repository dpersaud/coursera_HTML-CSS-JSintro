                        There's a stranger in my bed There's a pounding in my head Glitter all over the room  Pink flamingos in the pool I smell like a minibar DJ's passed out in the yard Barbies on the barbecue This a hickey or a bruise? Pictures of last night ended up online I'm screwed, oh, well It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled Damn

                        You change your mind Like a girl changes clothes Yeah you, PMS Like a bitch I would know And you over think Always speak Cryptically I should know That you're no good for me

                        Do you ever feel like a plastic bag Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again? Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in? Do you ever feel already buried deep? Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing Do you know that there's still a chance for you? 'Cause there's a spark in you You just gotta ignite the light
